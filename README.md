# Nuclear-Fusion-Calc

Fusion is the process of combining two or more atomic nuclei to form heaver nuclei.

> **Nuclei**: Plural for an atomic nucleus, which consists of *Protons* and *Neutrons*.

This process powers some of our biggest inventions over the times, such as the **Hydrogen Bomb**, which fuses two **Hydrogen Isotopes**, specifically **Deuterium** and **Tritium**, into a heavier element called **Helium-4**, thus producing tons of energy, according to Einstein's Energy-Mass Equivalence Equation.

This is the equation we're going to follow:

$$E=mc^2$$

$$m=3.34 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 5.0078 \times 10^{-27}$$
